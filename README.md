# Python Scripts

Here are some of my python scripts that I wrote when I first started out with python.
Over all the scripts I cover basics of python. \
Each script comes with its own README.md file explaing the purpose of the script, how to run the script, required libraries, implemented error checking, and for a couple pytest for testing.
